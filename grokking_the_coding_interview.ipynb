    "In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size. For example, take a look at this problem:\n",

    "Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we are asked to find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘5’ in the given array. Let’s solve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the first 5 numbers (subarray from index 0-4), the average is: (1+3+2+6-1)/5 => 2.2(1+3+2+6−1)/5=>2.2\n",
    "- The average of next 5 numbers (subarray from index 1-5) is: (3+2+6-1+4)/5 => 2.8(3+2+6−1+4)/5=>2.8\n",
    "- For the next 5 numbers (subarray from index 2-6), the average is: (2+6-1+4+1)/5 => 2.4(2+6−1+4+1)/5=>2.4\n",
    "…\n",
